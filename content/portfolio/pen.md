Olivewood- is a tree widely cultivated in sub-tropical areas of Europe, Africa and the Middle East for its olives. 

<!--more-->
The tree is of variable height and size, averaging 2' to 4' in diameter and 60 - 100 ft in height, although orchard trees are much shorter, with irregularly shaped logs. The wood is hard, heavy and strong. It may be straight-grained or interlocked, often with distinctive swirling colors of tan, brown and black. It dries easily but is prone to splitting. Olive wood is highly regarded for furniture, treen, bowls and utensils. The wood works beautifully and is easy on cutting tools. Interlocked specimens may be difficult to plane without tearing out. The wood may also be somewhat brittle. It sands and finishes well despite its waxy feel.
